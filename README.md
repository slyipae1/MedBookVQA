## Introduction
The rapid rise of general medical AI (GMAI), powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offers promising solutions to healthcare challenges like workforce shortages and rising costs. Systematic benchmarks are essential to evaluate and guide these technologies. Medical textbooks, though rich in structured knowledge, remain underutilized for this purpose.

We introduce **MedBookVQA**, a multimodal benchmark built from open-access medical textbooks. MedBookVQA contains 5,000 clinically meaningful visual-question-answering (VQA) tasks spanning five clinical task types: modality recognition, disease classification, anatomical identification, symptom diagnosis, and surgical procedures. To facilitate detailed performance analysis, the benchmark is organized by a hierarchical annotation system covering 42 imaging modalities, 125 anatomical structures, and 31 clinical specialties. 

MedBookVQA highlights the value of textbook-based benchmarks for advancing clinical AI and provides structured insights into current model limitations across medical domains.
